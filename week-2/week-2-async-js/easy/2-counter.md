## Counter without setInterval

Without using setInterval, try to code a counter in Javascript. There is a hint at the bottom of the file if you get stuck.

let count = 0;
setTimeout( () => {console.log(count++)}, 1000);

// setTimeout calls the function just one time after the delay time mentioned while setInterval calls the function after every interval of time provided.
